# Windows Server 2025 Virtual Installation Project

## Title & Outcome

Provisioned and validated two isolated Windows Server 2025 virtual machines (Desktop Experience and Core editions) on VirtualBox 7.0.20, demonstrating full OS deployment, credential setup, and Guest Additions installation.

---

## Problem / Objectives

Establish a repeatable workflow for cleanly installing and configuring both GUI-based and headless Windows Server 2025 environments.  

Key objectives:

- Deploy standardized evaluation VMs for future domain, WSUS, and hardening projects.  

- Validate VirtualBox hardware configuration and Guest Additions integration.  

- Confirm administrator + user account provisioning consistency.

## Environment & Prerequisites

| Component | Details |
|------------|----------|
| Host OS | Windows 11 Pro 22H2 (x64) |
| Virtualization Platform | VirtualBox 7.0.20 + Extension Pack |
| Guest OS ISO | Windows Server 2025 Standard Evaluation (Desktop and Core) |
| Memory Allocation | 4 GB RAM per VM |
| CPU Allocation | 2 vCPUs per VM |
| Storage Allocation | 80 GB dynamic VDI |
| Credentials | `administrator / <redacted-admin-password>` ; `labuser / <redacted-user-password>` |

---

## Steps Summary

1. Downloaded VirtualBox 7.0.20 and Extension Pack from official site.  

2. Created VM **Server-2025-Desktop** (4 GB RAM, 80 GB VDI, 2 vCPUs).  

3. Mounted Windows Server 2025 ISO and performed custom installation → new partition, automatic setup.  

4. Configured administrator account and signed in successfully.  

5. Created local user `labuser` with standardized passphrase.  

6. Installed VirtualBox Guest Additions via Devices menu → rebooted successfully.  

7. Created VM **Server-2025-Core** with same resource profile.  

8. Installed Server Core edition from same ISO and confirmed command-prompt environment.  

9. Executed `D:` → `VBoxWindowsAdditions.exe` within Core console to install Guest Additions.  

10. Ran `sconfig` to create user `labuser` and verified account listing.  

11. Took snapshots named "Initial Install with Tools" for both VMs.  

12. Backed up VM folders to external drive for disaster recovery.

## Evidence (text-only)

### Evidence 01 — VM Configuration Display

- *What would be visible:* VirtualBox main window showing VM names, base memory = 4096 MB, storage ≈ 80 GB.  

- *Text excerpt:*

  ```text

  Name: Server-2025-Desktop

  Base Memory: 4096 MB

  Storage: 80.00 GB (VDI)

  CPUs: 2

  ```

* *Why this matters:* Confirms hardware allocation meets deployment standards.

### Evidence 02 — Server Manager Launch on Desktop Edition

* *What would be visible:* Windows Server Manager dashboard displayed after first login.

* *Text excerpt:*

  ```text

  Server Manager – Dashboard

  Roles and Features Summary: No roles installed

  Computer Name: SERVER2025-DESKTOP

  ```

* *Why this matters:* Shows successful GUI installation and network initialization.

### Evidence 03 — User Accounts Panel

* *What would be visible:* Control Panel → User Accounts listing `Administrator` and `labuser`.

* *Text excerpt:*

  ```text

  Administrator (Local Account)

  labuser (Local Account)

  ```

* *Why this matters:* Proves local user creation without Microsoft sign-in.

### Evidence 04 — Guest Additions Installer Launch

* *What would be visible:* "Oracle VM VirtualBox Guest Additions Setup" wizard window.

* *Text excerpt:*

  ```text

  Oracle VM VirtualBox Guest Additions Setup Wizard

  Version 7.0.20

  ```

* *Why this matters:* Confirms driver integration to enable seamless mouse, display, and clipboard support.

### Evidence 05 — Windows Server Core Console

* *What would be visible:* Black command prompt window post-installation.

* *Text excerpt:*

  ```text

  Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.26100]

  (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

  C:\Windows\System32>

  ```

* *Why this matters:* Confirms minimal headless environment running properly.

### Evidence 06 — Guest Additions Install in Core

* *What would be visible:* Command prompt running installer from `D:` drive.

* *Text excerpt:*

  ```text

  D:\>VBoxWindowsAdditions.exe

  Installing VirtualBox Guest Additions 7.0.20…

  ```

* *Why this matters:* Shows integration of Guest Additions via CLI without GUI.

### Evidence 07 — `sconfig` User Creation

* *What would be visible:* sconfig menu confirming new local user.

* *Text excerpt:*

  ```text

  Enter username: labuser

  The command completed successfully.

  ```

* *Why this matters:* Demonstrates account management through Server Core utilities.

---

## Results & Validation

* Both VMs boot to expected interfaces (GUI and CLI).

* `administrator` and `labuser` accounts authenticated successfully.

* Guest Additions enabled shared clipboard and display resizing.

* Snapshots and backups created to ensure revertible states.

---

## Timeline / Activity Dates

* **2025-09-07** — VirtualBox 7.0.20 installed and tested

* **2025-09-07** — Windows Server 2025 Desktop installation completed

* **2025-09-07** — Local user `labuser` created and verified

* **2025-09-07** — Guest Additions installed on Desktop and Core VMs

* **2025-09-07** — Snapshots and VM backups finalized

---

## What I Learned

* Practiced creating virtual hardware profiles matching enterprise server requirements.

* Gained experience installing Server Core and navigating text-based management (`sconfig`).

* Reinforced understanding of credential policies and secure password standards.

* Verified Guest Additions functionality for system integration testing.

* Built foundational images for subsequent domain and update deployment projects.

---

## Troubleshooting Notes

* **Guest Additions Installer not auto-launching:** Manually mounted CD and ran `VBoxWindowsAdditions.exe`.

* **CTRL+ALT+DEL passthrough:** Used VirtualBox menu Input → Keyboard → Insert Ctrl+Alt+Del.

* **Account creation blocked by network login prompt:** Temporarily disconnected network adapter to force local user setup.

* **USB backup transfer error:** Reformatted drive to NTFS to support files > 4 GB.
